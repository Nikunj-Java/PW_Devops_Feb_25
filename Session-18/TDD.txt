What is TDD?
Test-Driven Development is a software development process where:
    1. you write the test first(it will fail at first).
    2. then you write just enough code to make the test pass
    3. finally you refractor the code for clarity and efficiency
it follows a Red---> Green---->Refractor Cycle
