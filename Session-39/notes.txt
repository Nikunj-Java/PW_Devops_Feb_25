in this tutorial we will learn how to launch Prometheus and Grafana using Terraform and AWS Ec2 Instance
Step:1 Create prometheus/.prometheus.yml file

Step:2 Create docker-compose.yml file

Step:3 Create main.tf file

Note: while using key

# Key Pair
resource "aws_key_pair" "deployer" {
  key_name   = "gf-key"
  public_key = file("/mnt/c/Users/NEW/.ssh/id_rsa.pub")
}

if key is note prepared , youo need to prepare it, if key already exist error coming into the picture change the name of the key

Step: 4 run Terraform
> terrform init
> terraform apply -auto-aprove

Step:5  check the Outputs

Outputs:
grafana_url = "http://3.91.47.25:3000"
prometheus_url = "http://3.91.47.25:9090"

Step:6 open grafana: http://3.91.47.25:3000
> login with initial credentials
    - username= admin
    - password= admin
> reset the password
> on the dashboard> click the grafana icon on left side
    > DATA SOURCES> click on Prometheus> give the name as prometheus
    > enter the url: http://3.91.47.25:9090
    > click on save and test
    output: 
    Successfully queried the Prometheus API.
    Next, you can start to visualize data by building a dashboard, or by querying data in the Explore view.

Now you can create your own dashbord here
