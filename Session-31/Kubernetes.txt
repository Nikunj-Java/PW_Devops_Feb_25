    - Scale apps up or down
    - Handle Networking, storage, and Load Balancing

Terms used in K8S:
----------------------------------------------------------
1. Pod: Smallest unit in kebernetes --it will run your container
2. Deployment: Manages pods -- help in updates, scaling,restarts
3. ConfigMap: stores non-sensitive app config(link .env)

5. ingress: Routes the traffic from outside into your service
6. PVC: Percistent Storage for your Application

How to Set up Kubernetes cluster locally??
----------------------------------------------------------
Step:1 Install the following
-----------------------------
1. kubectl
2. minikube

------------------------------
Step:2 Start the Minikube
------------------------------
> minikube start

-------------------------------
Step:3 Check the Status
-------------------------------
> kubectl get nodes

Exercise:1 Deploy a Simple Application
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
A. CREATE A Deployment

> kubectl create deployment my-nginx --image=nginx

    output: deployment.apps/my-nginx created

B. Check the Status
> kubectl get pods
    ______________________________________________________________
    |output:                                                      |              
    |NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE |
    |my-nginx-5b584c864b-mqhtw   1/1     Running   0          89s |   
    |_____________________________________________________________|
once the status is running we can proceed to the next part

C. Expose it with a service

> kubectl expose deployment my-nginx --port=80 --type=NodePort
output:
    service/my-nginx exposed

    Note: This will create a service that maps a random high port on your localmachine
> minikube service my-nginx --url
Output: 
http://127.0.0.1:43635
❗  Because you are using a Docker driver on linux, the terminal needs to be open to run it.
